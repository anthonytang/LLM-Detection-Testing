    "gpt_prediction": "Correct",
    "gpt_explanation": "Correct: The sentence presents a clear causal relationship (\"because the _ was heavy\") and involves physical properties (weight), both of which the model typically handles well.

    "gpt_explanation": "Correct: The sentence contains a clear causal structure with contrastive conjunctions (\"not because... but because...\") and an explicit causal clause (\"since the _ was loud\"), which aligns with the hypothesis that the LLM succeeds when causal relationships are syntactically clear and reinforced by cue words.",
