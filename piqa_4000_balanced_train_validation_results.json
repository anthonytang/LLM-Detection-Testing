Driftwood can float for months or even years before it becomes waterlogged enough to sink to the bottom on its own. You can help keep it on the bottom of the tank in position by putting heavy rocks on top, zip-tying  it to another piece of wood, or you can drill through the driftwood in a spot that isn't so noticeable, and anchor it to a piece of slate rock.",

    "solution_b": "Find the button that is damaged, open up the remote and determine what is causing the button to be sticky, place a large piece of gum or material between the button and the sheath of the remote, put it back together",
    "correct_answer": "Solution A",
    "gpt_prediction": "Correct",
    "gpt_explanation": "Correct: The model is likely to succeed due to its strong physical commonsense and safety bias, which would lead it to reject the implausible and messy idea of using gum in favor of a more practical material like tape. It also benefits from familiarity with everyday tools and repair logic.",

    "correct_answer": "Solution A",
    "gpt_prediction": "Incorrect",
    "gpt_explanation": "Incorrect: The model is likely to struggle here due to both options being absurd and involving fictional or prank-based reasoning, which falls outside its strong domains. It may default to surface-level fluency or familiarity (e.g., ketchup being more commonly associated with fake blood), but this is not grounded in practical logic.",

    "gpt_explanation": "Correct: The model is likely to succeed due to its strong physical commonsense and understanding of object affordances\u2014it can infer that placing the pick in a less accessible or visible location (like under the strings) helps avoid using it.

    "gpt_prediction": "Correct",
    "gpt_explanation": "Correct: The model is likely to succeed due to its strong physical commonsense and practical reasoning, recognizing that rinsing pasta with cool water is a common and effective method to stop cooking, whereas freezing is impractical and unnecessary. It also tends to eliminate implausible or overly extreme options like freezing cooked noodles.",
