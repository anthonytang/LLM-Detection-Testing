Pierce the fabric, sending the needle away from you, and bring it back out 1/8th of an inch further, in and out, each time. Repeat until the entire edge has been re-seamed.

    "gpt_explanation": "Correct: The model is likely to succeed due to its strong physical commonsense and familiarity with everyday kitchen tools, recognizing that a grater is the standard tool for shredding cheese, while a grinder is typically used for meat or spices. It should also eliminate the less plausible option based on real-world usage.",

    "goal": "How do you prep an old painted wooden nightstand top, for a new coat of paint?",
    "solution_a": "Rub 20 grit sandpaper in a circular motion all over until the top of the nightstand is smooth and the old paint is removed from the wood.",
    "solution_b": "Rub a washcloth in a circular motion all over until the top of the nightstand is smooth and the old paint is removed from the wood.",
    "correct_answer": "Solution A",
    "gpt_prediction": "Correct",
    "gpt_explanation": "Correct: The model is likely to succeed because it can apply strong physical commonsense and practical reasoning to recognize that sandpaper, not a washcloth, is appropriate for removing old paint and smoothing wood. It can also eliminate the implausible option (using a washcloth for paint removal) based on real-world feasibility.",

    "correct_answer": "Solution B",
    "gpt_prediction": "Correct",
    "gpt_explanation": "Correct: The model is likely to succeed due to its strong physical commonsense and practical reasoning, allowing it to recognize that a shirt provides better grip than a paint brush for opening a jar. It also tends to eliminate implausible or awkward options, making it more likely to reject the less practical tool.",

    "solution_a": "Once you have smoked the hive and opened it, observe the bees. Look for the bee that is the largest in size. She will also be the longer and more narrow than all the other bees. That will be the queen bee.",
    "solution_b": "Once you have smoked the hive and opened it, observe the bees. Look for the bee that is the smallest in size. She will also be the shortest and more narrow than all the other bees. That will be the queen bee.",
    "correct_answer": "Solution A",
    "gpt_prediction": "Correct",
    "gpt_explanation": "Correct: The model is likely to succeed due to its strong physical commonsense and practical reasoning, as well as familiarity with common beekeeping knowledge where the queen bee is typically larger. It should also eliminate the implausible option that contradicts this well-known fact.",

    "gpt_prediction": "Correct",
    "gpt_explanation": "Correct: The model is likely to succeed due to its strong procedural and physical commonsense reasoning, recognizing that boiling the liquid mixture before adding to flour is a standard step in making churro dough.

    "correct_answer": "Solution A",
    "gpt_prediction": "Correct",
    "gpt_explanation": "Correct: The model is likely to succeed due to its strong physical commonsense and familiarity with everyday tools and procedures, such as knowing that chicken feeders are standard for feeding hens, while placing food in a box on a roost is less practical. It can also eliminate the less plausible option based on typical poultry care practices.",
